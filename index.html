	<p>
	Motivated with a passion for creative and efficient data-driven solutions, and a technology enthusiast. My specialties include end-to-end data analysis, statistical and predictive modeling, software conceptualization and wire-frame prototyping.<br/>
	Work experience include working as Business Intelligence Analyst and Software Project Associate, handling projects for the State department(s).<br/></p>
	
	<p>Highly skilled in: R, Python, Machine learning and Deep Learning Algorithms, Tableau, SAS, SQL and Wire-frame prototyping.
		<br/> With experience and passion for algorithms and predictive modeling on large-scale datasets using the machine learning, statistical data modeling, pattern recognition and data mining techniques. I am also the data mining teaching assistant for the Data Science Grad Program.</p>

	<p>I believe, learning is an iterative process (true for both Humans and Machines) and for me, new iterations will be added every single day, till the end of days.</p>
	
	<strong> Here are some of my projects:</strong>
